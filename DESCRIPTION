Description: Provides tools for exploring series with periodic coefficients through
    dot products of the form sum(f[i]*g[i]). Includes pre-built periodic sequences
    (sine, cosine, triangle, square waves) and base sequences (harmonic, geometric,
    exponential decay, Fibonacci). Useful for studying Fourier-like series, signal
    analysis, and understanding how periodic coefficients affect series convergence.
    Results can be visualized with built-in plotting methods.
