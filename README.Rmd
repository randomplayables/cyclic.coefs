# cyclic.coefs

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of cyclic.coefs is to explore sequences with periodic coefficients.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cyclic.coefs from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("randomplayables/cyclic.coefs")
```

## Basic Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use the combine() function.

```{r example}
library(cyclic.coefs)

combine(.f = \(x) (1:12)/12,
                    .g = \(x) unlist(lapply(1:36, \(x)exp(-x))))
```
